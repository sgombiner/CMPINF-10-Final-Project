# CMPINF-10-Final-Project
A project that determines the best Pittsburgh neighborhood for outdoor entertainment. This metric is determined by three sub-metrics: the amount of facilities, the amount of parks, and the amount of baseball fields all per neighborhood. We have concluded that Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood by this metric due to its overwhelming advantage in its combined percentage of facilities, parks, and baseball fields in Pittsburgh.

## Conclusions

* Sam Gombiner:
  My data pointed toward the possibility of Squirrel Hill South being the best neighborhood, however, that wasn't the first thing I would have hypothesized due to the overwhelming number of parks that East Liberty and Central Business District held. Still, our method of taking the average of each dataset percentage per neighborhood, combining them, and then comparing them to identify the neighborhood with the biggest cross-over was the most logical step and accurately calculates a best neighborhood based on our metric of outdoor entertainment. On a more personal level, I was quite happy for Squirrel Hill South to be our choice for the best neighborhood, as it's the primary area of Pittsburgh I find myself in, as I greatly enjoy the food options there. So in summary I agree with our data's finding not only on a quantitative level but also on a qualitative. 
  
* Heegwon Yang: As someone who has only lived in Pittsburgh for 2+ years, I haven't come up with a "personal favorite" Pittsburgh neighborhood yet. However, when I went to Squirrel Hill to buy a birthday present for my dad, one thing I noticed was how "lived-in" the whole neighborhood was. There were a lot of small businesses, from record shops to bakeries to restaurants. Furthermore, I saw of group of kids walking together with backpacks on their backs: probably coming home from school. It may be admittedly shortsighted to judge a neighborhood solely from a day visit, but when I saw the final results, I wasn't really surprised that Squirrel Hill South was determined as the "best neighborhood" with the data we chose: there's a lot to do there and explore, even if it seems smaller than Downtown or Oakland.

  Brookline has the most facilities related to entertainment. However, the non-entertainment related facilities in Brookline isn't soo high. Squirrel Hill South rating number 5 in entertainment and number 2 in non-entertainment facilities, so we consider it's the best neighborhood related to facilities. I'm not surprised that Squirrel Hill has been named the best neighborhood because I will also be moving there from my dormitory next semester. I have looked into the area and found that not only is it safe, but it also has a full range of amenities nearby, including gas stations, supermarkets, restaurants, entertainment facilities, sports fields, and more, all intertwined with public transportation.
