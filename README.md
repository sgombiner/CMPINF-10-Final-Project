# CMPINF-10-Final-Project
A project that determines the best Pittsburgh neighborhood for outdoor entertainment. This metric is determined by three sub-metrics: the amount of facilities, the amount of parks, and the amount of baseball fields all per neighborhood. We have concluded that Squirrel Hill South is the best neighborhood by this metric due to its overwhelming advantage in its combined percentage of facilities, parks, and baseball fields in Pittsburgh.
